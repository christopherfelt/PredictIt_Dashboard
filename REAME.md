This project is in progess

In this project, I am developing a PredictIt dashboard creator. The dashboard will contain the pricing information for market chosen. This dashboard creator will be developed to be used with Excel and Google Sheets. Future features will include getting data from various sources such as twitter. 


PredictIt for Excel

Description:
This tool allows a user to choose markets based on keyword and market duration. The tool will then load this data into an Excel spreadsheet.


Progress:
This tool is complete and ready for use. Please see the predict_dashboard1.py file. 


PredictIt for Google Sheets:

Description:
This tool allows a user to choose markets based on keyword and market duration. The tool will then load this data into a Google Sheets spreadsheet.

Progress:
I can reuse most of the code for the first. I need to finish researching Google Sheets API and writing up the code.
